# Thank you for installing FOOTSIES: Neural Network Edition!

This project takes HiFight's game, "Footsies" and implements a neural network to play against!
The neural network takes control of player 1, and you can either let it battle the CPU or play against it as player 2.

## Build Instructions

You must have Python installed to run this project. You can install python **here:** https://www.python.org/downloads/
This project is also only available on windows.

With Python installed, follow the instructions below to setup the project:

    - Open the "FOOTSIES-NEURAL-NETWORK-EDITION-V1.0.0\NeuralNetwork" directory in windows file explorer.
    - In the file explorer, click on the directory tree above all the files.
    - Type "cmd", windows command prompt should open, with the current directory set to the neural network folder.
    - In the cmd, type the following:
    
        "python -m pip install -r requirements.txt"

      This will use pip to install all required dependencies.
    - Once pip has finished installing, you're done!

## Operation Instructions

Once the project has been setup, simply executing the "FOOTSIES.exe" file will run the game.
Upon running the game, a Python server will open up. Please wait for confirmation from the server that the network has loaded and the client-server link established (this may take a while on your first launch).
Once the server is up, the game is good to go!

If you would like to take control of player 1 at any given time, simply close the Python server, and control will be restored.
